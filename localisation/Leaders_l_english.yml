 Francesco_Zingales_desc:0 "Francesco Zingales, born in 1884, Had a relatively uneventful military career. Fighting in the Isonzo Front in World War 1, and participating in the Italian invasion of Yugoslavia after their refusal to cede us the land promised by the Treaty of London. But all that changed when he became the commander of the Italian Expeditionary force to the Eastern Front. \n\nDuring his time in the Eastern Front, Zingales started to understand the untamed East. The brutal weather, the hostile land, and the Slavic people of east, he even began learning Russian to better communicate with civilians to hopefully increase compliance. And as the war drew towards its conclusion, territorial gains were being consolidated, and it quickly became apparent that Zingales was the obvious choice to take command of the newly acquired Crimean peninsula during Operation NERO. Zingales is aware of The magnitude of his command, being the only thing standing between the Reich and near free access to the Mediterranean. \n\nAnd despite being increasingly isolated from the rest of the Empire, the increasing hostility of the locals, and the Germans setting their sights on the peninsula. Zingales will continue to serve valiantly until his last breath. \n\nTo protect his homeland, and to protect his family in Messina."
 
 joseph_stalin_desc:0 "Ioseb Jughashvili, more commonly known as Joseph Stalin, has failed. Failed in his mission to protect the motherland. But how could he have failed, with the entire power of the U.S.S.R. behind him?\n\nStalin is an effective leader, there can be no doubt of that. He knows when to be tough and heartless, and when to show humanity and solidarity, like in the legendary speech he made in the wake of Barbarossa. But for all his leadership, because in the end, the Soviet Union was beaten to its knees, a shadow of its former self. \n\nStalin claims it was the fault of his generals and high command, who didn’t follow Order No. 227 "Not a step back!". But his enemies, and the Union’s remaining population, blame him directly and personally. They claim the Great Purge in the 1930s doomed the Union by removing a number of professional and experienced generals, which if kept alive, could have stopped the unopposed Wehrmacht during the huge disaster that was Operation Barbarossa, and the following Japanese invasion. \n\nDissent never was a problem for Stalin, as the NKVD and the army, once staunch supporters of Stalin, had always dealt with any unrest with professionalism. But as it turns out, his accusations of the army caused large groups of generals and soldiers to defect to his opposition, making Stalin rapidly lose power, and putting his life in real danger. Stalin needs to find a way to regain his popularity amongst the public and respect from the army. \n\nHe will either succeed in this enormous task, or he will die trying."
