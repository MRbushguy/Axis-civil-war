 Francesco_Zingales_desc:0 "Francesco Zingales, born in 1884, Had a relatively uneventful military career. Fighting in the Isonzo Front in World War 1, and participating in the Italian invasion of Yugoslavia after their refusal to cede us the land promised by the Treaty of London. But all that changed when he became the commander of the Italian Expeditionary force to the Eastern Front. \n\nDuring his time in the Eastern Front, Zingales started to understand the untamed East. The brutal weather, the hostile land, and the Slavic people of east, he even began learning Russian to better communicate with civilians to hopefully increase compliance. And as the war drew towards its conclusion, territorial gains were being consolidated, and it quickly became apparent that Zingales was the obvious choice to take command of the newly acquired Crimean peninsula during Operation NERO. Zingales is aware of The magnitude of his command, being the only thing standing between the Reich and near free access to the Mediterranean. \n\nAnd despite being increasingly isolated from the rest of the Empire, the increasing hostility of the locals, and the Germans setting their sights on the peninsula. Zingales will continue to serve valiantly until his last breath. \n\nTo protect his homeland, and to protect his family in Messina."
 
 joseph_stalin_desc:0 "Ioseb Jughashvili, more commonly known as Joseph Stalin, has failed. Failed in his mission to protect the motherland. But how could he have failed, with the entire power and resources of the Soviet Union behind him?\n\nStalin is an effective leader, there can be no doubt of that. He knows when to be tough and heartless, and when to show humanity and solidarity, like in the legendary speech he made in the 1941 October Revolution Parade in the wake of Barbarossa. But it doesn't matter in the end, because for all his leadership, the Soviet Union was beaten to its knees, a shadow of its former self. \n\nStalin claims it was the fault of his generals and high command, who didn’t follow Order No. 227 "Not a step back!". But his enemies, and the Union’s remaining population, blame him directly and personally. They claim the Great Purge in the 1930s doomed the Union by removing a number of professional and experienced generals, which if kept alive, could have stopped the unopposed Wehrmacht during the huge disaster that was Operation Barbarossa, and could have also be more prepared for the Japanese invasion of Sibera. \n\nDissent never was a problem for Stalin, as the NKVD and the army, once staunch supporters of Stalin, had always dealt with any unrest with professionalism. But as it turns out, his accusations of the army caused large groups of generals and soldiers to defect to his opposition, making Stalin rapidly lose power, and putting his life in real danger. Stalin needs to find a way to regain his popularity amongst the public and respect from the army. \n\nHe will either succeed in this enormous task, §Ror he will die trying§!."

Adolf_Hitler_desc:0 "In this new era, Adolf Hitler stands at the head of a grand empire, stretching from the slopes of the alps to the barren fiords of the north, from the Atlantic port of La Rochelle to the bitter waters of Arkhangelsk. His long-envisioned dream of a “Reich to stand for a thousand years” is all but accomplished. Hitler is the hero of millions of German men, women, and children, and his enemies within and without have been beaten into submission or silence.  \n\nAnd yet the Fuehrer's time, by all accounts, seems to be drawing short. For the past eight years, Hitler has undergone a violent and frequent usage of dangerous and addictive drugs. This substance abuse, coupled with the strains of a difficult campaign in the east, has worn down the Fuehrer's once fiery will and sharp vision - he is now a shadow of his former self, leaving the running of Germany to the NSDAP, and other high-ranking political figures. \n\nBut the final trial of Hitler’s life is not over. As challenging as it was to establish a New world order, maintaining it will be even harder. Factionalism in the country’s high command and political system quickly rose after the end of the war as different visions for Germany clashed more and more frequently. The plunder economy has already shown worrying signs of failing and our social system of war glory was never designed for peace. And now Germany has a grand empire that they need to maintain and suppress. \n\But Hitler must endure this final trial, for §RHitler is Germany, and Germany is Hitler§!."

muslini_desc:0 "When in 1922 Benito Mussolini said that he will restore the glory of the Roman Empire, his enemies laughed. Now 25 years later, his enemies laugh no more. \n\nIn just a couple of years, with the help of his newly developed ideology of fascism, Mussolini transformed Italy from a nation on the verge of anarchy, to a mighty contender on Europe with a powerful economy. To the point of making Italy almost untouched by the great depression that swept the world. Under Mussolini's supervision, the army, navy, and air force were greatly expanded and reexamined to ensure professionalism was high, making sure they will avoid another brutal trench warfare. And all of these reforms paid off hugely when the seconda guerra mondiale kicked off, and Italy swept through Africa, southern France, and the Balkans like it was butter. And even thinking long term by taking control of Crimea and the caucuses, which weakened Germany greatly. Italy entered the war a nation and left it as a global superpower. As a new roman empire. \n\nBut still, Mussolini is worried. His age is starting to catch up to him, and possible assassination by a grunted African or a Balkan native are very much a possibility, and Mussolini fears that without him, this new roman empire wouldn’t survive. Mussolini needs a backup, Mussolini needs a §Ysuccessor §!"
