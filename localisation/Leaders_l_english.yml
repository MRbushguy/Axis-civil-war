 Francesco_Zingales_desc:0 "Francesco Zingales, born in 1884, Had a relatively uneventful military career. Fighting in the Isonzo Front in World War 1, and participating in the Italian invasion of Yugoslavia after their refusal to cede us the land promised by the Treaty of London. But all that changed when he became the commander of the Italian Expeditionary force to the Eastern Front. \n\nDuring his time in the Eastern Front, Zingales started to understand the untamed East. The brutal weather, the hostile land, and the Slavic people of east, he even began learning Russian to better communicate with civilians to hopefully increase compliance. And as the war drew towards its conclusion, territorial gains were being consolidated, and it quickly became apparent that Zingales was the obvious choice to take command of the newly acquired Crimean peninsula during Operation NERO. Zingales is aware of The magnitude of his command, being the only thing standing between the Reich and near free access to the Mediterranean. \n\nAnd despite being increasingly isolated from the rest of the Empire, the increasing hostility of the locals, and the Germans setting their sights on the peninsula. Zingales will continue to serve valiantly until his last breath. \n\nTo protect his homeland, and to protect his family in Messina."
 
 joseph_stalin_desc:0 "Ioseb Jughashvili, more commonly known as Joseph Stalin, has failed. Failed in his mission to protect the motherland. But how could he have failed, with the entire power and resources of the Soviet Union behind him?\n\nStalin is an effective leader, there can be no doubt of that. He knows when to be tough and heartless, and when to show humanity and solidarity, like in the legendary speech he made in the 1941 October Revolution Parade in the wake of Barbarossa. But it doesn't matter in the end, because for all his leadership, the Soviet Union was beaten to its knees, a shadow of its former self. \n\nStalin claims it was the fault of his generals and high command, who didn’t follow Order No. 227 "Not a step back!". But his enemies, and the Union’s remaining population, blame him directly and personally. They claim the Great Purge in the 1930s doomed the Union by removing a number of professional and experienced generals, which if kept alive, could have stopped the unopposed Wehrmacht during the huge disaster that was Operation Barbarossa, and could have also be more prepared for the Japanese invasion of Sibera. \n\nDissent never was a problem for Stalin, as the NKVD and the army, once staunch supporters of Stalin, had always dealt with any unrest with professionalism. But as it turns out, his accusations of the army caused large groups of generals and soldiers to defect to his opposition, making Stalin rapidly lose power, and putting his life in real danger. Stalin needs to find a way to regain his popularity amongst the public and respect from the army. \n\nHe will either succeed in this enormous task, §Ror he will die trying§!."

Adolf_Hitler_desc:0 "In this new era, Adolf Hitler stands at the head of a grand empire, stretching from the slopes of the alps to the barren fiords of the north, from the Atlantic port of La Rochelle to the bitter waters of Arkhangelsk. His long-envisioned dream of a “Reich to stand for a thousand years” is all but accomplished. Hitler is the hero of millions of German men, women, and children, and his enemies within and without have been beaten into submission or silence.  \n\nAnd yet the Fuehrer's time, by all accounts, seems to be drawing short. For the past eight years, Hitler has undergone a violent and frequent usage of dangerous and addictive drugs. This substance abuse, coupled with the strains of a difficult campaign in the east, has worn down the Fuehrer's once fiery will and sharp vision - he is now a shadow of his former self, leaving the running of Germany to the NSDAP, and other high-ranking political figures. \n\nBut the final trial of Hitler’s life is not over. As challenging as it was to establish a New world order, maintaining it will be even harder. Factionalism in the country’s high command and political system quickly rose after the end of the war as different visions for Germany clashed more and more frequently. The plunder economy has already shown worrying signs of failing and our social system of war glory was never designed for peace. And now Germany has a grand empire that they need to maintain and suppress. \n\But Hitler must endure this final trial, for §RHitler is Germany, and Germany is Hitler§!."

muslini_desc:0 "When in 1922 Benito Mussolini said that he will restore the glory of the Roman Empire, his enemies laughed. Now 25 years later, his enemies laugh no more. \n\nIn just a couple of years, with the help of his newly developed ideology of fascism, Mussolini transformed Italy from a nation on the verge of anarchy, to a mighty contender on Europe with a powerful economy. To the point of making Italy almost untouched by the great depression that swept the world. Under Mussolini's supervision, the army, navy, and air force were greatly expanded and reexamined to ensure professionalism was high, making sure they will avoid another brutal trench warfare. And all of these reforms paid off hugely when the seconda guerra mondiale kicked off, and Italy swept through Africa, southern France, and the Balkans like it was butter. And even thinking long term by taking control of Crimea and the caucuses, which weakened Germany greatly. Italy entered the war a nation and left it as a global superpower. As a new roman empire. \n\nBut still, Mussolini is worried. His age is starting to catch up to him, and possible assassination by a grunted African or a Balkan native are very much a possibility, and Mussolini fears that without him, this new roman empire wouldn’t survive. Mussolini needs a backup, Mussolini needs a §Ysuccessor §!"

grandi_desc:0 "Pretty much everyone in the P.N.F was surprised when Dino Grandi announced his support to the reformist Fascists. After all, he was there right from the start of fascism. Joining the fascist movement even before the march on Rome, when the Fascist party was much less respected. And during his whole time in the party, he was a vivid supporter of Fascism and Mussolini. But it wasn’t any form of Italian blunder or general incompetence that changed his mind, it was Germany and Nazism that did. \n\nIt is obvious Fascism and Nazism are similar in a lot of ways, in fact, Hitler admitted that Nazism drawn a lot of inspiration of fascism. So, when this ideology that is very similar to fascism starts to rot and decay, wouldn’t that be concerning? Well, it certainly was concerning for Dino Grandi. Who argues that Italian fascism is heading the exact same way of rot and decay. And that reformist fascism is the only way to change that course and to maintain a prosperous and victorious Italy"

Galbiati_desc:0 "It takes a lion to lead a legion of tigers, and Enzo Emilio Galbiati has certainly proved that he is a lion. \n\nGalbiati	already did his fair share in changing the course of history. He was within the group of blackshirts that urged Mussolini to abandon democracy and to establish the glorious dictatorship that led them to total victory. But as they say, the work is never done. And even after being briefly expelled for participating in this "revolt", he was readmitted to the PNF and the MVSN, a wise decision since Galbiati rose through the ranks and became the chief of staff and eventually became the national commander itself of the MVSN. \n\nJust like many other MVSN members, Galbiati too felt that Italy became too soft regarding internal security. And that its only a matter of time until the communists and German spies would rear their ugly head, and that this would come to bite Italy in the worst time possible. So, he teamed up with the man who was leading this way of thinking to hopefully prevent it, Alessandro Pavolini. \n\nThis was the first steps toward the triumvirate. As it became clear that Pavolini couldn’t exert enough influence and respect amongst the blackshirt soldiers. But Galbiati was already the feared and respected national commander. And so, it was agreed. Galbiati would stay in the blackshirt ranks and be the enforcer of the government. Making sure to rat out the spies. And protecting Italy to ensure an everlasting prosperity"

Muti_desc:0 "Often nicknamed "Little D'Annunzio" and "The child of Fiume" Ettore Muti is one of Fascism's oldest friends. With their friendship dating back all the way to 1919, to the times of the Italian Regency of Carnaro. Muti still has memories of him and his brothers in arms from the Arditi walking in the streets of Fiume, at the time he thought this was just a fun adventure. But he didn’t realize that a revolutionary ideology was developing right Infront of his eyes. \n\nHis opponents say that "Muti had his chance in 39' and now he should move on" referring to his controversial decision to resign from his position as the party secretary of the PNF to join the war. But that excuse didn’t stop him from begin the new duce of Italy. \nBut many people still question him, why he, the flamboyant man that joined the war because he was bored of sitting in an office chair all day decided suddenly to return to politics? \n\nWell, according to Muti, his experiences at the frons, and the massive expansion of Italy, rejuvenated him. It reminded him of his good old days in fiume, it filled him again with a sense of adventure and purpose. And for him, a new fascist revolution, to restore fascism to the glory days of fiume. Is the best path for an eternal Fascist revolution \n\nMuti WILL succeed in his task. He is D'Annunzio's chosen, and if he ever loses hope in his cause, he will just remember what D'Annunzio told him. \n\n §G"You are the expression of Superhuman values, a weightless impetus, a boundless offering, a fistful of incense over the embers, the scent of a pure soul"§!"
