Fighting in the Isonzo Front in World War 1, and participating in the Italian invasion of Yugoslavia after their refusal to cede us the land promised by the Treaty of London. But all that changed when he became the commander of the Italian Expeditionary force to the Eastern Front. \n\nDuring his time in the Eastern Front, Zingales started to understand the untamed East. The brutal weather, the hostile land, and the Slavic people of east, he even began learning Russian to better communicate with civilians to hopefully increase compliance. And as the war drew towards its conclusion, territorial gains were being consolidated, and it quickly became apparent that Zingales was the obvious choice to take command of the newly acquired Crimean peninsula during Operation NERO. Zingales is aware of The magnitude of his command, being the only thing standing between the Reich and near free access to the Mediterranean. \n\nAnd despite being increasingly isolated from the rest of the Empire, the increasing hostility of the locals, and the Germans setting their sights on the peninsula. Zingales will continue to serve valiantly until his last breath. \n\nTo protect his homeland and to protect his family in Messina."
