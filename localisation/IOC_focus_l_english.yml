 all_alone_desc:0 "We have no neighbouring allies, no one to rely on, only enemies. We are a lone soldiers with our backs to the sea. As we find ourselves in a very precarious situation, it is of the highest priority of our garrison to maintain good relations with the native peoples of the peninsula. Both to mitigate resistance from partisans, and to boost the morale of our increasingly homesick soldiers"

 an_ocean_away_desc:0 "The only route from the homeland to us is through the Black Sea. If conflict breaks out, equipment and soldiers may arrive too late. As such, it is up to us to adapt to the situation and to start to learn how to survive without aid. By using the collaborationists for manpower, hoarding supplies, and making sure our defences are fully operational, maybe we could stave off the krauts just long enough."
