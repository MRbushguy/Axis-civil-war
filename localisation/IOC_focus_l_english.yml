 surrounded_by_the_swastikas_desc:0 "From Armyansk to Kerch, from Ukraine to Kaukasia, we are completely surrounded by the Reich and its puppets. The high command of the garrison is not very optimistic, but we will still do everything we can to stave off the krauts from our homeland's shores."

 all_alone_desc:0 "We have no neighboring allies, no one to rely on, only enemies. We are lone soldiers with our backs to the  Sea. With such precarious situation it is extremely important to maintain good relations with the natives of the peninsula.  Both to lessen resistance from partisans, and to increase morale from our increasingly homesick soldiers"

 an_ocean_away_desc:0 "The only route from the homeland to us is through the Black Sea. If conflict breaks out, equipment and soldiers may arrive too late. As such, it is up to us to adapt to the situation and to start to learn how to survive without aid. By using the collaborationists for manpower, hoarding supplies, and making sure our defences are fully operational, maybe we could stave off the krauts just long enough."
