 ussr3: "The politburo  elections" 

 SOV_shattered_union:0 "A Shattered Union"
 SOV_shattered_union_desc:0 "Once, there existed a union of 16 soviet socialist republics. But now, Lenin's beautiful dream is shattered. We have lost more than half of our land and our cities lie in the hands of the Fascists. We find ourselves stuck in the middle of Siberia, surrounded by enemies, With only central Asia left as a part of our old union." 
 
 SOV_trust_in_stalin:0 "Trust in Stalin"
 SOV_trust_in_stalin_desc:0 "Even though Stalin failed to lead us to victory during the great patriotic war, there is still hope for the rusty Man of Steel. Stalin is still a very capable leader, and has shown that he would change if necessary. It would also save us the problem of electing a new General Secretary and avoid the possibility of a non-communist leader taking power."
 
 SOV_new_gen:0 "Down With The Traitors"
 SOV_new_gen_desc:0 "The old bolsheviks in the government are responsible  for this humiliation. Especially That traitor Stalin. Because of his idiotic purges, we lost the great patriotic war and we are stuck in Siberia. It's time for him to be trialed and face the consequences of his defeats. We will set up elections in the party for a new leader. No matter whether he is a communist or not."
