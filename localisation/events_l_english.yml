 situations.1.t:0 "The situations: Crimea"
 situations.1.d:0 "In one of the most bizarre events in modern history, on September 11, 1941. As German forces started crossing the Dnieper river, Italian marines from the 1st San Marco Regiment landed around the port of Sevastopol and the Kerch Peninsula as a part of operation NERO and quickly secured the entire Crimean region in a week. While officially claimed to be in order to avoid getting bogged down in the city of armyansk in the northern part of Crimea. In truth it was a calculated and strategic move with one goal in mind. Preventing Germany from getting access to the Mediterranean. \n\nAnd as the relations between the two young superpowers quickly deteriorate, a conflict is brewing in the east. Both sides claiming the land, and neither side willing to give up. \n\And so, Crimea quickly became another contentious spot in this new order. With Germany doing everything it can to wipe the garrison out of krim, and Italy doing everything it can to protect their shiny and glorious middle terranean from the krauts. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

 situations.2.d:0 "To the northwestern part of France lies a country not a single person thought they would live to see, the state of Brittany. But this state, is not Breton at all, this state in an excuse, an excuse to escape the oppression of the third Reich and to taste the freedom for just a bit longer. \n\nAs it became clear that Nazi Germany is not going away anytime soon, and with it stays the oppression and with it the Restrictions on Civil Liberties, the people of the Britianny region hatched a plan to escape. they would stage a "revolt" a "popular revolt" to declare a new country, the state of Britianny. which would be independent and neutral. With the French army non existent, and the Wehrmacht occupied in the east, the plan worked, and the state of Britianny birthed to existence. \n\nThe strategic value of Britianny is immense, begin virtually at the gate of Europe, any country that controls Brest can basically blockade the entirety of northern Europe, that includes Germany. \n\nAnd so, Britianny quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with German troops trying to bring the disobeying region back to France, and Italy doing everything it can to keep Britianny alive and functioning. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

 situations.3.t:0 "The situations: The Fatherland front"
 situations.3.d:0 ""The Fatherland front never really faded away, even after the Anschluss of Austria and the attempts to suppress the party, the ultranationalist Fatherland front managed to stay relatedly alive and active, thanks mostly to Italian support. \n\nDuring the days of ww2 and the pact of steel, Italy condemned the fatherland front as a terrorist organization, but as relations with the Germans soured greatly Italy started to reapproach the fatherland front in attempts to sabotage the Reich from within. Using terrorism, pro Austrian propaganda, and displaying the failures and the inhumane actions of their beloved Reich to everyone. \n\nDoing such action is a great risk. If successful, Austrian succession would be a disaster for Germany as it would show to the whole world the level of incompetence in the government of the Reich, and would shatter the belief of its citizens that they live in a great and prosperous country. On the other hand, if the Germans find out about the extensiveness of this operation, things could very quickly escalate. \n\nAnd so, Austria quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with Germany trying to quell resentment in Austria, and Italy trying to break free the Austrians from the German monsters. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

 situations.4.t:0 "The situations: Occupations of france"
 situations.4.d:0 "During the interwar years, fascist Italy has invested a great deal in reforming its military to avoid another disastrously long war. Mussolini made sure to stamp out any form of corruption or rivalries and to put profession over ideology, and using a reformed doctrine of artillery and air support, and using the high morale and patriotism of the common Italian soldier,  The Bolzano military exercise was a  Total success, but the Italian high command decided to not brag about the result of the  exercise. To make their next opponent underestimate them. And it's clear to say that their trick worked, their next opponent very much underestimated them. \n\nWhen French war planners discussed the Italian alpine front, it was decided that only a couple of brigades and airplanes will defend, and the vast and harsh mountains will do the rest of the defending. So when news were received in Paris that Italian offensives have begun in the alps, the military and government were not very worried, but the Italians thrusted through the alps like it was butter, and just in a couple of days, the Italians marched in Nice, and then Lyon, and then Toulouse, and on the 27th of May, 1940, Italian boots have reached Bordeaux, and at that moment the whole world discovered The true power of the Forze Armate Italiane. \n\nAnd when France announced their surrender on the 13th of July, it was reluctantly agreed that the Italians would occupy all of southern France and Germany would occupy the north, but as the war came to a close tensions rose regarding post war France, As both sides wanted their occupied territory to rule all of France. \n\nAnd so, France quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with Germany and Italy trying to increase the legitimacy of their respective puppet governments in France, trying destabilize the other's legitimacy, and preparing for the eventual war that will decide the future of the Land of tragedy and suffering that is France. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

 #GERMANY

 germany.1.t:0 "Hitler's speech"
 germany.1.d:0 "The crowd waited expectantly as Adolf Hitler shuffled to the stand to give his speech. There were mild murmurs in the crowd, as the Fuhrer moved slower, less purposefully then he had used to, but these whispers were soon quelled as he began to speak. As he spoke of a new, free Germany, his voice had all the hallmarks of his famous energy and vigor. But there were those in the crowd that saw different. Saw the occasional mistakes, the slip-ups, the physical toll that this simple speech was taking on the man. These watchers knew, as the Fuhrer said, that a new Germany was arising. But as to who would lead this new empire - only time would tell."
