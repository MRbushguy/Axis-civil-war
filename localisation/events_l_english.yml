 situations.1.d:0 "In one of the most bizarre events in modern history, on September 11, 1941. As German forces started crossing the Dnieper river, Italian marines from the 1st San Marco Regiment initiated landings around the port of Sevastopol and the Kerch Peninsula as a part of operation NERO, quickly wiped the shocked and weak soviet garrison, and secured the entire Crimean region in a week. While officially claimed to be in order to avoid getting bogged down in the city of armyansk in the northern part of Crimea. In truth it was a calculated and strategic move with one goal in mind. Preventing Germany from getting access to the Mediterranean. \n\nGermany having free access to the black sea, and thus to the whole Mediterranean, would be a disaster for Italy and their sphere, having the Kriegsmarine patrolling in the Aegean Sea would be a direct contest to italy's power in the region. It could risk Greece having a pro Germany coup, the Bulgarians breaking from the pact with Italy, now that the Germans are at their shores, and make Italy overall much weaker in the world's eyes. And these are also the reasons why Germany also wants krim, and why it will never give up \n\nAnd so, Crimea quickly became another contentious spot in this new order. With Germany doing everything it can to wipe the garrison out of krim, and Italy doing everything it can to protect their shiny and glorious middle terranean from the krauts. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

But this state, is not Breton at all, this state in an excuse, an excuse to escape the oppression of the third Reich and to taste the freedom for just a bit longer. \n\nAs it became clear that Nazi Germany is not going away anytime soon, and with it stays the oppression and with it the Restrictions on Civil Liberties, the people of the Britianny region hatched a plan to escape. they would stage a "revolt" a "popular revolt" to declare a new country, the state of Britianny. which would be independent and neutral. With the French army non existent, and the Wehrmacht occupied in the east, the plan worked, and the state of Britianny was birthed to existence. \n\nThe strategic value of Britianny is immense, begin virtually at the gate of Europe, any country that controls Brest can basically blockade the entirety of northern Europe, that includes Germany. \n\nAnd so, Britianny quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with German troops trying to bring the disobeying region back to France, and Italy doing everything it can to keep Britianny alive and functioning.

Using terrorism, pro Austrian propaganda, and displaying the failures and the inhumane actions of their beloved Reich to everyone. \n\nDoing such action is a great risk. If successful, Austrian succession would be a disaster for Germany as it would show to the whole world the level of incompetence in the government of the Reich, and would shatter the belief of its citizens that they live in a great and prosperous country. On the other hand, if the Germans find out about the extensiveness of this operation, things could very quickly escalate. \n\nAnd so, Austria quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with Germany trying to quell resentment in Austria, and Italy trying to break free the Austrians from the German monsters.

To make their next opponent underestimate them. And it's clear to say that their trick worker, their next opponent very much underestimated them. \n\nWhen French war planners discussed the Italian alpine front, it was decided that only a couple of brigades and airplanes will defend, and the vast and harsh mountains will do the rest of the defending. So when news were received in Paris that Italian offensives have begun in the alps, the military and government were not very worried, but the Italians thrusted through the alps like it was butter, and in just a couple of days, the Italians marched in Nice, and then Lyon, and then Toulouse, and on the 27th of May, 1940, Italian boots have reached Bordeaux, and at that moment the whole world discovered The true power of the Forze Armate Italiane. \n\nAnd when France announced their surrender on the 13th of July, it was reluctantly agreed that the Italians would occupy all of southern France and Germany would occupy the north, but as the war came to a close tensions rose regarding post war France, As both sides wanted their occupied territory to rule all of France. \n\nAnd so, France quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with Germany and Italy trying to increase the legitimacy of their respective puppet governments in France, trying destabilize the other's legitimacy, and preparing for the eventual war that will decide the future of the Land of tragedy and suffering that is France.

 situations.5.d:0 ""Oil, we need oil" This was the unanimously agreed decision in the oberkommando der Wehrmacht. As the mighty German army rolled through the east, the mud, the resistance, and the -40 degrees Celsius, began to set in. The tanks slowed to a halt, the trucks were starting to sink, and the soldiers froze to death. Just barely the Germans managed to capture Moscow with the skin of their teeth and hold it during the soviet winter offensive, largely thanks to the Chita offensive that was happening at the same time by japan.  But there was hope for the Germans, in the caucus, in the Azerbaijan ssr, in Baku. In the attempt to conquer the caucus oil, the Case Blue plan was created. But another power has set their eyes on the treasure chest of the black gold, Italy. \n\nWhile more oil would always be welcome, surprisingly, the reason wasn’t that Italy would have the oil, but that Germany wouldn’t. At that stage of the war, cracks had formed in the Pact of Steel, and Italian politicians and generals urged to make some long-term plans, and this was one of them. In a secret agreement with turkey, Italy was given free military access to Armenia and Georgia, and turkey had been given the Aegean and Dodecanese islands. When the Germans found out about the Italian invasion, they were furious, and launched an all-out spear assault toward Baku, and a sort of race began, the race to Baku. In the end, Italy barely won, with the Germans being only 80KM away from Baku and Sumgait. The Germans were of course furious, claiming this as stolen land, and the Italians of course, refused to give it up, claiming it as war gain. And with diplomacy out of the window, military actions started to occur, constant border clashes, attempts of disruption, agitation of locals, everything possible to make the other side's life a living hell. \n\nAnd so, Baku quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with German soldiers constantly harassing Italian border gaurd, and Italy doing everything it can to keep Germany out of reach from the black gold.

 situations.6.d:0 "The territories of Slovenia and Switzerland were always eyed upon by the great powers of fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Whether because of promised territory that wasn’t given, or the dream of pan germanism. But for a time, these territories were safe from conquest. Grantees by stronger powers, being a part of a larger and stronger country, or giving protections and benefits to their expansionist neighbors. But the outbreak of the second world war, destroyed that protection, and these territories became under the immediate threat of a foreign occupation. \n\nWhen Yugoslavia refused to concede the dalmatian coast to Italy, Italy invaded with a 4-front assault from mainland Italy, Albania and Greece, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Yugoslavia fell within a week, and when the territories were partitioned between the invaders, Italy has chosen to completely annex the Slovenia (with the exception of the region of Muraszombat), much to the displeasure of Germany, who had planned a partition of Slovenia with Italy. \n\nDuring the war, Switzerland has constructed one of the most extreme defense plans in modern history, blowing up all the connections of the country to the outside world, to prepare for the eventual invasions of Italy and Germany. But when Operation Tannenbaum was launched, and tunnels and bridges were blown, the armies just stood outside the country, and waited. Soon the expected famines erupted, and the constant rain of bombs destroyed what remains of the morale of the citizens. After 6 months, Switzerland surrendered. In the partition, Italy seized southern Switzerland, and Germany took the rest. For Germany, this was again a betrayal, as Operation Tannenbaum was mainly their operation, and southern Switzerland had a large amount of native Germans who are now in an Italian speaking country. \n\nAnd so, the territories of Slovenia and Switzerland quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with Germany trying to disrupt and agitate revolts among the German locals, and Italy trying to maintain order and compliance among the german locals.

 soviet.1.t:0 "The Military Parade in Sverdlovsk"
 soviet.1.d:0 "It was clear to Stalin that he needed to act fast. His legitimacy and popularity in the eyes of the public were in total free fall. His dreadful enemies within the party had garnered enough support that Stalin knew a coup was imminent. In order to regain control of the Party and the Union itself Stalin made one final gamble. He organized a military parade of unprecedented scale in the "temporary" capital of Sverdlovsk. \n\nT-34's, ZIS-6's with Katyusha's, and veterans from all parts of the front which had survived the Great Patriotic War were gathered and brought to parade standards. The veterans for the parade were given the newest prototype rifles, new uniforms adorned with specially issued medals, and even artillery was readied to be ceremoniously fired. The success of this parade, a projection of the General Secretary's remaining strength, and parallel action taken by loyal NKVD and police regiments would decide the fate of Stalin and the Union. \n\nThe people rejoiced as the Red Army marched proudly through the streets of Sverdlovsk. The parade gave the Red Army new luster which had been seemingly been lost to the invading Wehrmacht years prior. Such a display inspired hope amongst the remaining, displaced Soviet citizenry. After the glorious procession Stalin gave a speech, in front of tens of thousands of people, which was simultaneously broadcast to every radio and television in the whole Soviet Union, even in occupied territories to the west. \n\nIn his now legendary 40-minute Sverdlovsk speech Stalin spoke in a somber tone. The veil of invincibility of the Red Army and thus the Party had been tattered for years but this sentiment had never been expressed by the General Secretary publically. For a moment it appeared as though Stalin could cry, cry for every man, woman and child lost to the German menace. \n\nThe crowds were enraptured, his high command shocked until stoically Stalin stated “We are not defeated, the Revolution will prevail!” This received minutes long rapturous ovation. Stalin continued as barracks, offices, and homes were stormed. Traitors to the Party were escorted to secret prisons and re-education facilities far to the north. \n\nFear and devotion had been restored, Stalin's gamble had succeeded"

soviet.2.d:0 "T-34’s rolled through Sverdlovsk, cities throughout the Union saw either open combat or subversive maneuvering between those loyal to Stalin and those loyal to the remaining members of the Politburo. Days of maneuvers between loyal and traitorous elements of the Army, police, NKVD, and various small scale skirmishes left nearly 150 dead and several hundred wounded. Prisons were filled with political rivals through several serieses of arrests. The will of the Party, and thus the Revolution had ended the terror of one man. \n\nA show trial reminiscent of the Yezhovshchina was then arranged for the traitorous, cowards, disgraced members of the Politburo. This old guard including Vyacheslav Molotov, Anastas Mikoyan, Mikhail Kalinin and many others were presented with litanies of crimes including plotting against the Soviet Union with the goal of advancing the interests of themselves, thus revealing their bourgeois immorality, treason in the motherland, and many more. All of the defendants were found guilty and executed by a firing squad. The only 2 men from the government which were spared from these accusations were Lazar Kaganovich and Kliment Voroshilov. Both were spared as they were in the frontlines fighting the Germans, and were seen as victims of the rot in the government \n\n And as for Joseph Stalin, former General Secretary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, he was also charged and found guilty of treason and betrayal of the revolution. But he was not with his co-conspirators against the wall, as he was being held elsewhere in order to prevent enemies of the Soviet Union from aiding him in escaping justice. \n\nStalin’s loss of power was far from gradual, but precipitous. His totalitarian control evaporated almost overnight. The Politburo all but refused to assemble and met secretly without his knowledge. Lists of traitors given to the NKVD were lost or not followed through. Stalin knew the noose was tightening around him. so before the ensuing chaos he began to move further east, giving up the city of Sverdlovsk and any semblance of control. Moving in unmarked trucks, narrowly avoiding detection by traitorous Red Army checkpoints. But Stalin could not evade capture. On a freezing night through winding paths his convoy was ambushed by heavily armed NKVD. The fighting was fierce, even Stalin returning fire, but they were doomed from the start, as the ambush was 3 times the size of their convoy. \n\nIoseb Besarionis Jughashvili would be transported to a secret prison far away from Sverdlovsk, in Vaygach island. Where he would be finally executed. \n\nLavrentiy Beria welcomed him to his new, short life."

Aleksey reached for the bag he had brought, and with trembling hands pulled out a slew of matches. His fingers shook, but his arms were strong from decaades of work in these fields. One by one he lit the matches, and tossed them into different parts of the field. Across Ukraine he knew farmers were doing the exact same thing. In time the deed was finished.

The engine whirred, but the car and the rest of the convoy came to a full stop. In an instant, the grain fields at the borders of the road exploded with movement, hundreds of men silently swarming towards the cars.

And due to some smart strategic decisions, even the new mighty power, and our most new and threatening enemy, Germany, has been denied their access to the Mediterranean and to the Caucasian oil. \n\nItaly has conquered itself an empire from Bordeaux to Dar es Salaam, from the Atlantic to the Indian ocean. \n\nItaly is once again, a mighty lion.

Elements of the Regio Esercito and the Regia Marina marched in parade proudly as the latest Fiat fighter planes of the Regia Aeronautica roared overhead in an impressive airshow. Leaders of the Gioventù Italiana del Littorio were followed by enthusiastic uniformed youths who were honored to march in parade with decorated veterans in front of none other than Il Duce himself. Carro Armato M 20/46’s rolled through the streets, and the words "Giovinezza!" and "Avanti Italia!" were shouted by the enormous crowds which lined the streets of Rome. \n\nTowards the end of the parade elements of colonial divisions marched in parade as well.native soldiers mostly from the lands of Eritrea, Somalia, and libya. But also some recently added native ethiopian soldiers. Added in the hopes of increasing intergration to the Empire. \n\nBut then, for some unexplained reason, not long after they started marching, 2 Ethiopian soldiers stopped in their tracks, right in front of where Mussolini watched the event. They started yelling "Zeraf, Zeraf!" ,pointed their rifle at Mussolini, \n\nAnd each of them fired a single shot, directly at Mussolini."

What if the bullet was fired a little more to the left and he was killed? Who will lead Italy after him? will italy survive the chaos of the aftermath? \n\nIt's not like Mussolini was unfamiliar with death. In 1926, he was shot by a mentally ill Irish lady. And the bullet barley missed his face and hit him in the nose. But this time it's different. Now Italy is a superpower, but a new and inexperienced one. If Italy wants to keep this status for the years to come, they need to stabilize their spere, or it will all come crashing down on Italy. And if he was to be assassination, it could certainly trigger a crippling power struggle, and a crisis which would certainly make this nightmare become a reality. \n\nAnd so at that moment, Mussolini made a decision. Just like in the old days of the roman empire, He would train a successor, A Co-Duce. So that when his time would come to an end, he will have a competent person that will lead after him. \n\nAnd he decided to do that in the most extreme way possible. \nHe would step down as Duce. And will allow another person to assume his leadership, while he would be in the background. Observing the progress of his empire. And ready to intervene if things go wrong."
