 situations.1.t:0 "The situations: Crimea"
 situations.1.d:0 "In one of the most bizarre events in modern history, on September 11, 1941. German forces had started to cross the Dnieper river, Italian marines from the 1st San Marco Regiment landed around the port of Sevastopol and the Kerch Peninsula as a part of Operation Nero and quickly secured the Crimean region in a week. While officially claimed to be so that German troops wouldn’t get bogged down in the city of Armyansk, in northern Crimea. In reality it was a calculated and strategic move with one goal in mind. Preventing Germany from taking control of the Black Sea and getting access to the Mediterranean. \n\nAnd as the relations between the two newly emerging superpowers deteriorate, a conflict is brewing in the east. Both sides claim the land, and neither side is willing to give it up. \n\And so, Crimea quickly became another contentious spot in this new order. With Germany doing everything it can to drive the garrison out of the peninsula, and Italy doing everything it can to protect their Mediterranean Sea from the Krauts. And with that, yet another point of geopolitical instability has been created, bringing Europe closer to another Great War.”

 situations.2.d:0 "To the northwestern part of France lies a country not a single person thought they would live to see again, the state of Brittany. But this state is not Breton at all, that is but a pretense, an excuse to escape the oppression of the third Reich and to hold on to freedom. \n\nAs it becomes clear that the Reich is not going to go away anytime soon, and that the longer the Reich stays, the longer the oppression of the French peoples and the suppression of their freedoms, the people of Brittany hatched a plan to escape the overstretched tentacles of the Reich. They would stage a "revolt" a "popular revolt" to declare a new country and secede from German France, the state of Brittany. which would be independent and neutral. With only a couple of garrisons in France, and most the Wehrmacht occupied with the war in the east, the plan worked, and the state of Brittany was born. \n\nThe strategic value of Brittany is immense, as it is situated at the mouth of the English Channel, any country that controls Brest can virtually block the English Channel and cause massive economic damages to the entirety of northern Europe, which includes Germany. \n\nAnd so, Brittany quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with German troops trying to bring the rebellious region back to the fold, and Italy doing everything it can to keep Brittany afloat. And with that, yet another powderkeg in Europe is created, waiting for it’s time to explode and bring another brutal war to Europe.”

 situations.3.t:0 "The situations: The Fatherland front"
 situations.3.d:0 "The Fatherland front never really faded away, even after the Anschluss of Austria and the attempts to suppress the party, the ultranationalist Fatherland Front managed to stay relatedly alive and active, mostly due to Italian support. \n\nDuring the war and the pact of steel, Italy condemned the Fatherland Front as a terrorist organisation, but as relations with the Germans started to sour, Italy started to approach the Fatherland Front in order to sabotage the Reich from within. Utilising terrorist hit-and-run tactics, pro Austrian propaganda, and propaganda displaying the failures and the inhumane crimes of their beloved Reich for all to see. \n\nSupporting such groups such groups comes with great risk though. If successful, Austrian secession would be a disaster for Germany as it would show to the world the incompetence of the Reich, and would disillusion the populace, it would shatter the common belief among it’s citizens that they live in a great and prosperous country. On the other hand, if the Germans find out about the extensiveness of this operation, things could very quickly escalate. \n\nAnd so, Austria quickly became another highly unstable spot in this  shaky new order, with Germany desperately trying to quell resentment in Austria, and Italy trying to free the Austrians from the German monsters. And with that, another powderkeg is created, waiting for its time to explode and bring yet another brutal war to Europe.”

 situations.4.t:0 "The situations: Occupations of France"
 situations.4.d:0 "During the interwar years, fascist Italy invested a great deal in reforming its military to avoid another disastrously long war. Mussolini made sure to stamp out any form of corruption or rivalries and to make sure the military put profession over ideology, using a reformed doctrine of artillery and air support and utilising the high morale and patriotism of the common Italian soldier to it’s full effect. The Bolzano military exercise was a great success, but the Italian high command decided to not spread information about the results of the exercise to make their next opponent underestimate them. It can be clearly seen that their trick worked, as their next opponent very much underestimated them. \n\nWhen French war planners discussed the Italian alpine front, it was decided that a couple of infantry units, airplanes and the vast and hard-to-cross Alpine mountain range would be sufficient enough to  repel any offensives the Italians threw at them. So when news reached Paris that Italian offensives had begun in the Alps, the incompetent French high command were not very worried, but when the Italians pierced through the alpine defensive lines, and in just a couple of days captured Nice, then Lyon, then Toulouse on the 27th of May, 1940, Italian troops reached Bordeaux, and at that moment the whole world discovered the true power of the Forze Armate Italiane, the French high command was stunned and failed to even escape when the Germans captured Paris a few weeks later. \n\nAnd when France announced their surrender on the 13th of July, it was reluctantly agreed that the Italians would occupy all of southern France and Germany would occupy the north, but as the war came to a close tensions rose regarding post war France, As both sides wanted to have rule over all of France. \n\nAnd so, France quickly became a greatly disputed area, with Germany and Italy trying to increase the legitimacy of their respective puppet governments in France, trying invalidate each other’s claims over the land, and preparing for the eventual war that will decide the future of the Land of Tragedy and suffering that is France. And with that, there is yet another contested region in Europe, bringing Europe ever closer to another war.”

 situations.5.t:0 "The situations: The Baku border clashes"
 situations.5.d:0 "'Oil, we need oil' This was the unanimously agreed decision in the Oberkommando. As the mighty German Wehrmacht rolled through the east, through the mud, through the worn-down roads, the -30 degrees winter began to set in. The tanks slowed to a halt, the trucks started to sink, and the soldiers froze to death. The Germans barely managed to capture Moscow and hold it during the Soviet winter offensive, largely thanks to the Chita offensive that was happening in the east at the same time by Japan, drawing Soviet forces away from the western front.  But there was hope for the Germans, deep in the Caucasus, in the Azerbaijan SSR, in the oil fields of Baku. In an attempt to conquer the Caucasus oil, the Case Blue plan was created. But another power had set their eyes on the treasure chest of liquid gold, Italy.\n\nWhile more oil would always be welcome for the Italians, surprisingly, the main reason wasn’t that Italy would have the oil, but that Germany wouldn’t. At that stage of the war, cracks had already formed in the Pact of Steel, and Italian politicians and generals urged to make long-term plans, and this was one of them. In a secret agreement with Turkey, Italy was given military access to Armenia and Georgia in exchange for the Aegean and Dodecanese islands. When the Germans found out about the Italian invasion, they were furious, and launched an all-out assault speeding towards Baku, and a race began, the race to Baku. In the end, Italy only barely managed seize Baku, with the Germans only 80 kilometres away from Baku and Sumgait. The Germans were of course furious, claiming it was stolen land, and the Italians refused to give it up and responded by claiming it was a prize of war. This only served to sour relations even further and with diplomacy off of the table, conflicts started to occur all over the lower Caucasus, constant border clashes, the disrupting of railroads, the funding of local insurgents, both sides did everything possible to make the other side's life a living hell in the vain hope that it would drive the other side out of the Caucasus. \n\nAnd so, Baku became yet another highly disputed spot, with German soldiers constantly harassing Italian border guards, and Italy doing everything it can to keep Germany away from the rich oil fields. Yet another single point of failure in this precarious new order.”

 situations.6.t:0 "The situations: German claims on Slovenia and Switzerland"
 situations.6.d:0 "The territories of Slovenia and Switzerland were always eyed upon by the great powers of fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Whether because of promised territory that wasn’t given, or the dream of pan germanism. But for a time, these territories were safe from conquest. Grantees by stronger powers, being a part of a larger and stronger country, or giving protections and benefits to their expansionist neighbors. But the outbreak of the second world war, destroyed that protection, and these territories became under the immediate threat of a foreign occupation. \n\nWhen Yugoslavia refused to concede the dalmatian coast to Italy, Italy invaded with a 4-front assault from mainland Italy, Albania and Greece, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Yugoslavia fell within a week, and when the territories were partitioned between the invaders, Italy has chosen to completely annex the Slovenia (with the exception of the region of Muraszombat), much to the displeasure of Germany, who had planned a partition of Slovenia with Italy. \n\nDuring the war, Switzerland has constructed one of the most extreme defense plans in modern history, blowing up all the connections of the country to the outside world, to prepare for the eventual invasions of Italy and Germany. But when Operation Tannenbaum was launched, and tunnels and bridges were blown, the armies just stood outside the country, and waited. Soon the expected famines erupted, and the constant rain of bombs destroyed what remains of the morale of the citizens. After 6 months, Switzerland surrendered. In the partition, Italy seized southern Switzerland, and Germany took the rest. For Germany, this was again a betrayal, as Operation Tannenbaum was mainly their operation, and southern Switzerland had a large amount of native Germans who are now in an Italian speaking country. \n\nAnd so, the territories of Slovenia and Switzerland quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with Germany trying to disrupt and agitate revolts among the German locals, and Italy trying to maintain order and compliance among the german locals. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

There were whispers and murmurs among the crowd as the Fuhrer moved slower, less purposefully than he had used to, but these whispers were soon quelled as he began to speak. As he spoke of a new, free Germany, his voice had all the hallmarks of his famous energy and vigor. But there were those in the crowd that saw different. Saw the occasional mistakes, the slip-ups, the physical toll that just a speech was taking on the man. These watchers knew, as the Fuhrer said, that a new Germany was arising. But as to who would lead this new empire - only time would tell."
