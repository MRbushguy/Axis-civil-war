 situations.1.t:0 "The situations: Crimea"
 situations.1.d:0 "In one of the most bizarre events in modern history, on September 11, 1941. As German forces started crossing the Dnieper river, Italian marines from the 1st San Marco Regiment landed around the port of Sevastopol and the Kerch Peninsula as a part of operation NERO and quickly secured the entire Crimean region in a week. While officially claimed to be in order to avoid getting bogged down in the city of armyansk in the northern part of Crimea. In truth it was a calculated and strategic move with one goal in mind. Preventing Germany from getting access to the Mediterranean. \n\nAnd as the relations between the two young superpowers quickly deteriorate, a conflict is brewing in the east. Both sides claiming the land, and neither side willing to give up. \n\And so, Crimea quickly became another contentious spot in this new order. With Germany doing everything it can to wipe the garrison out of krim, and Italy doing everything it can to protect their shiny and glorious middle terranean from the krauts. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

 situations.2.d:0 "To the northwestern part of France lies a country not a single person thought they would live to see, the state of Brittany. But this state, is not Breton at all, this state in an excuse, an excuse to escape the oppression of the third Reich and to taste the freedom for just a bit longer. \n\nAs it became clear that Nazi Germany is not going away anytime soon, and with it stays the oppression and with it the Restrictions on Civil Liberties, the people of the Britianny region hatched a plan to escape. they would stage a "revolt" a "popular revolt" to declare a new country, the state of Britianny. which would be independent and neutral. With the French army non existent, and the Wehrmacht occupied in the east, the plan worked, and the state of Britianny was birthed to existence. \n\nThe strategic value of Britianny is immense, begin virtually at the gate of Europe, any country that controls Brest can basically blockade the entirety of northern Europe, that includes Germany. \n\nAnd so, Britianny quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with German troops trying to bring the disobeying region back to France, and Italy doing everything it can to keep Britianny alive and functioning. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

 situations.3.t:0 "The situations: The Fatherland front"
 situations.3.d:0 "The Fatherland front never really faded away, even after the Anschluss of Austria and the attempts to suppress the party, the ultranationalist Fatherland front managed to stay relatedly alive and active, thanks mostly to Italian support. \n\nDuring the days of ww2 and the pact of steel, Italy condemned the fatherland front as a terrorist organization, but as relations with the Germans soured greatly Italy started to reapproach the fatherland front in attempts to sabotage the Reich from within. Using terrorism, pro Austrian propaganda, and displaying the failures and the inhumane actions of their beloved Reich to everyone. \n\nDoing such action is a great risk. If successful, Austrian succession would be a disaster for Germany as it would show to the whole world the level of incompetence in the government of the Reich, and would shatter the belief of its citizens that they live in a great and prosperous country. On the other hand, if the Germans find out about the extensiveness of this operation, things could very quickly escalate. \n\nAnd so, Austria quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with Germany trying to quell resentment in Austria, and Italy trying to break free the Austrians from the German monsters. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

 situations.4.t:0 "The situations: Occupations of france"
 situations.4.d:0 "During the interwar years, fascist Italy has invested a great deal in reforming its military to avoid another disastrously long war. Mussolini made sure to stamp out any form of corruption or rivalries and to put profession over ideology, and using a reformed doctrine of artillery and air support, and using the high morale and patriotism of the common Italian soldier,  The Bolzano military exercise was a  Total success, but the Italian high command decided to not brag about the result of the exercise. To make their next opponent underestimate them. And it's clear to say that their trick worker, their next opponent very much underestimated them. \n\nWhen French war planners discussed the Italian alpine front, it was decided that only a couple of brigades and airplanes will defend, and the vast and harsh mountains will do the rest of the defending. So when news were received in Paris that Italian offensives have begun in the alps, the military and government were not very worried, but the Italians thrusted through the alps like it was butter, and in just a couple of days, the Italians marched in Nice, and then Lyon, and then Toulouse, and on the 27th of May, 1940, Italian boots have reached Bordeaux, and at that moment the whole world discovered The true power of the Forze Armate Italiane. \n\nAnd when France announced their surrender on the 13th of July, it was reluctantly agreed that the Italians would occupy all of southern France and Germany would occupy the north, but as the war came to a close tensions rose regarding post war France, As both sides wanted their occupied territory to rule all of France. \n\nAnd so, France quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with Germany and Italy trying to increase the legitimacy of their respective puppet governments in France, trying destabilize the other's legitimacy, and preparing for the eventual war that will decide the future of the Land of tragedy and suffering that is France. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

 situations.5.t:0 "The situations: The Baku border clashes"
 situations.5.d:0 ""Oil, we need oil" This was the unanimously agreed decision in the oberkommando der Wehrmacht. As the mighty German army rolled through the east, the mud, the resistance, and the -40 degrees Celsius, began to set in. The tanks slowed to a halt, the trucks were starting to sink, and the soldiers froze to death. Just barely the Germans managed to capture Moscow with the skin of their teeth and hold it during the soviet winter offensive, largely thanks to the Chita offensive that was happening at the same time by japan.  But there was hope for the Germans, in the caucus, in the Azerbaijan ssr, in Baku. In the attempt to conquer the caucus oil, the Case Blue plan was created. But another power has set their eyes on the treasure chest of the black gold, Italy. \n\nWhile more oil would always be welcome, surprisingly, the reason wasn’t that Italy would have the oil, but that Germany wouldn’t. At that stage of the war, cracks had formed in the Pact of Steel, and Italian politicians and generals urged to make some long-term plans, and this was one of them. In a secret agreement with turkey, Italy was given free military access to Armenia and Georgia, and turkey had been given the Aegean and Dodecanese islands. When the Germans found out about the Italian invasion, they were furious, and lunched an all-out spear assault toward Baku, and a sort of race began, the race to Baku. In the end, Italy barely won, with the Germans being only 80KM away from Baku and Sumgait. The Germans were of course furious, claiming this as stolen land, and the Italians of course, refused to give it up, claiming it as war gain. And with diplomacy out of the window, military actions started to occur, constant border clashes, attempts of disruption, agitation of locals, everything possible to make the other side's life a living hell. \n\nAnd so, Baku quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with German soldiers constantly harassing Italian border gaurd, and Italy doing everything it can to keep Germany out of reach from the black gold. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"
