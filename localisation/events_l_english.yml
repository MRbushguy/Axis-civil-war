 situations.1.t:0 "The situations: Crimea"
 situations.1.d:0 "In one of the most bizarre events in modern history, on September 11, 1941. As German forces started crossing the Dnieper river, Italian marines from the 1st San Marco Regiment initiated landings around the port of Sevastopol and the Kerch Peninsula as a part of operation NERO, quickly wiped the shocked and weak soviet garrison, and secured the entire Crimean region in a week. While officially claimed to be in order to avoid getting bogged down in the city of armyansk in the northern part of Crimea. In truth it was a calculated and strategic move with one goal in mind. Preventing Germany from getting access to the Mediterranean. \n\nGermany having free access to the black sea, and thus to the whole Mediterranean, would be a disaster for Italy and their sphere, having the Kriegsmarine patrolling in the Aegean Sea would be a direct contest to italy's power in the region. It could risk Greece having a pro Germany coup, the Bulgarians breaking from the pact with Italy, now that the Germans are at their shores, and make Italy overall much weaker in the world's eyes. And these are also the reasons why Germany also wants krim, and why it will never give up \n\And so, Crimea quickly became another contentious spot in this new order. With Germany doing everything it can to wipe the garrison out of krim, and Italy doing everything it can to protect their shiny and glorious middle terranean from the krauts. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

 situations.2.d:0 "To the northwestern part of France lies a country not a single person thought they would live to see, the state of Brittany. But this state, is not Breton at all, this state in an excuse, an excuse to escape the oppression of the third Reich and to taste the freedom for just a bit longer. \n\nAs it became clear that Nazi Germany is not going away anytime soon, and with it stays the oppression and with it the Restrictions on Civil Liberties, the people of the Britianny region hatched a plan to escape. they would stage a "revolt" a "popular revolt" to declare a new country, the state of Britianny. which would be independent and neutral. With the French army non existent, and the Wehrmacht occupied in the east, the plan worked, and the state of Britianny was birthed to existence. \n\nThe strategic value of Britianny is immense, begin virtually at the gate of Europe, any country that controls Brest can basically blockade the entirety of northern Europe, that includes Germany. \n\nAnd so, Britianny quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with German troops trying to bring the disobeying region back to France, and Italy doing everything it can to keep Britianny alive and functioning. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

 situations.3.t:0 "The situations: The Fatherland front"
 situations.3.d:0 "The Fatherland front never really faded away, even after the Anschluss of Austria and the attempts to suppress the party, the ultranationalist Fatherland front managed to stay relatedly alive and active, thanks mostly to Italian support. \n\nDuring the days of ww2 and the pact of steel, Italy condemned the fatherland front as a terrorist organization, but as relations with the Germans soured greatly Italy started to reapproach the fatherland front in attempts to sabotage the Reich from within. Using terrorism, pro Austrian propaganda, and displaying the failures and the inhumane actions of their beloved Reich to everyone. \n\nDoing such action is a great risk. If successful, Austrian succession would be a disaster for Germany as it would show to the whole world the level of incompetence in the government of the Reich, and would shatter the belief of its citizens that they live in a great and prosperous country. On the other hand, if the Germans find out about the extensiveness of this operation, things could very quickly escalate. \n\nAnd so, Austria quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with Germany trying to quell resentment in Austria, and Italy trying to break free the Austrians from the German monsters. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

 situations.4.t:0 "The situations: Occupations of france"
 situations.4.d:0 "During the interwar years, fascist Italy has invested a great deal in reforming its military to avoid another disastrously long war. Mussolini made sure to stamp out any form of corruption or rivalries and to put profession over ideology, and using a reformed doctrine of artillery and air support, and using the high morale and patriotism of the common Italian soldier,  The Bolzano military exercise was a  Total success, but the Italian high command decided to not brag about the result of the exercise. To make their next opponent underestimate them. And it's clear to say that their trick worker, their next opponent very much underestimated them. \n\nWhen French war planners discussed the Italian alpine front, it was decided that only a couple of brigades and airplanes will defend, and the vast and harsh mountains will do the rest of the defending. So when news were received in Paris that Italian offensives have begun in the alps, the military and government were not very worried, but the Italians thrusted through the alps like it was butter, and in just a couple of days, the Italians marched in Nice, and then Lyon, and then Toulouse, and on the 27th of May, 1940, Italian boots have reached Bordeaux, and at that moment the whole world discovered The true power of the Forze Armate Italiane. \n\nAnd when France announced their surrender on the 13th of July, it was reluctantly agreed that the Italians would occupy all of southern France and Germany would occupy the north, but as the war came to a close tensions rose regarding post war France, As both sides wanted their occupied territory to rule all of France. \n\nAnd so, France quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with Germany and Italy trying to increase the legitimacy of their respective puppet governments in France, trying destabilize the other's legitimacy, and preparing for the eventual war that will decide the future of the Land of tragedy and suffering that is France. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

 situations.5.t:0 "The situations: The Baku border clashes"
 situations.5.d:0 ""Oil, we need oil" This was the unanimously agreed decision in the oberkommando der Wehrmacht. As the mighty German army rolled through the east, the mud, the resistance, and the -40 degrees Celsius, began to set in. The tanks slowed to a halt, the trucks were starting to sink, and the soldiers froze to death. Just barely the Germans managed to capture Moscow with the skin of their teeth and hold it during the soviet winter offensive, largely thanks to the Chita offensive that was happening at the same time by japan.  But there was hope for the Germans, in the caucus, in the Azerbaijan ssr, in Baku. In the attempt to conquer the caucus oil, the Case Blue plan was created. But another power has set their eyes on the treasure chest of the black gold, Italy. \n\nWhile more oil would always be welcome, surprisingly, the reason wasn’t that Italy would have the oil, but that Germany wouldn’t. At that stage of the war, cracks had formed in the Pact of Steel, and Italian politicians and generals urged to make some long-term plans, and this was one of them. In a secret agreement with turkey, Italy was given free military access to Armenia and Georgia, and turkey had been given the Aegean and Dodecanese islands. When the Germans found out about the Italian invasion, they were furious, and lunched an all-out spear assault toward Baku, and a sort of race began, the race to Baku. In the end, Italy barely won, with the Germans being only 80KM away from Baku and Sumgait. The Germans were of course furious, claiming this as stolen land, and the Italians of course, refused to give it up, claiming it as war gain. And with diplomacy out of the window, military actions started to occur, constant border clashes, attempts of disruption, agitation of locals, everything possible to make the other side's life a living hell. \n\nAnd so, Baku quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with German soldiers constantly harassing Italian border gaurd, and Italy doing everything it can to keep Germany out of reach from the black gold. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"

 situations.6.t:0 "The situations: German claims on Slovenia and Switzerland"
 situations.6.d:0 "The territories of Slovenia and Switzerland were always eyed upon by the great powers of fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Whether because of promised territory that wasn’t given, or the dream of pan germanism. But for a time, these territories were safe from conquest. Grantees by stronger powers, being a part of a larger and stronger country, or giving protections and benefits to their expansionist neighbors. But the outbreak of the second world war, destroyed that protection, and these territories became under the immediate threat of a foreign occupation. \n\nWhen Yugoslavia refused to concede the dalmatian coast to Italy, Italy invaded with a 4-front assault from mainland Italy, Albania and Greece, Bulgaria, and Hungary. Yugoslavia fell within a week, and when the territories were partitioned between the invaders, Italy has chosen to completely annex the Slovenia (with the exception of the region of Muraszombat), much to the displeasure of Germany, who had planned a partition of Slovenia with Italy. \n\nDuring the war, Switzerland has constructed one of the most extreme defense plans in modern history, blowing up all the connections of the country to the outside world, to prepare for the eventual invasions of Italy and Germany. But when Operation Tannenbaum was lunched, and tunnels and bridges were blown, the armies just stood outside the country, and waited. Soon the expected famines erupted, and the constant rain of bombs destroyed what remains of the morale of the citizens. After 6 months, Switzerland surrendered. In the partition, Italy seized southern Switzerland, and Germany took the rest. For Germany, this was again a betrayal, as Operation Tannenbaum was mainly their operation, and southern Switzerland had a large amount of native Germans who are now in an Italian speaking country. \n\nAnd so, the territories of Slovenia and Switzerland quickly became another contentious spot in this new order, with Germany trying to disrupt and agitate revolts among the German locals, and Italy trying to maintain order and compliance among the german locals. And with that, another powderkeg evolves, waiting for the time to explode and bring another brutal war in Europe"
