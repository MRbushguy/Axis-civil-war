With their gradual loss of influence within the German military as a result of the stall of barbarossa, the leaders of the £decision_faction_ger_wehr_small §YWehrmacht§! have decided to take control of the apparatus of state to ensure that their vision of a strong, hardened Germany is realized."

The Waffen-SS has always been an organization stuck between two influences: that of the SS and that of the German military. Now that they have become a force to be reckoned with, they must choose whether to stick with their SS roots, reform into a true world class military force, or maybe even evolve into something new entirely."

Although Himmler was personally given by Hitler the "noble" mission of the SS to Germanize northern France, which significantly weakened the influence of the Schutzstaffel  in Germania, they are still a powerful and influential force. And Himmler is still very active in party politics and rivalries, although from afar."
